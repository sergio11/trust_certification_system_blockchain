TCS uses Blockchain technology in order to provide inviolability, immutability and easy verification for all your certificates. This platform guarantees students and certificate authorities the possibility of issuein a digital and unforgeable version of their certificates and it is guaranteed that any interested third party can verify their integrity.

A Certification Authority and a Student reach an agreement in order to issue a certificate on the platform, this certificate is generated, signed and stored using cryptographic techniques. Later, the Student can go to any other institution and share their certificate, whose veracity can be verified directly on the platform without having to contact the institution that issued it again.

The implementation of the private blockchain network means that there are many copies of the information, all of them necessary and absolutely identical. This makes fraud impossible, and also guarantees the survival of the certificates issued by the certification authority, even though that said Institution disappears. The certificates thus issued are perennial and immutable.

## Why Blockchain Technology?

The Blockchain technology is a new technology that appeared in 2008 that allows information to be recorded with guarantees of originality and security never possible before. It is based on a cryptographic system that allows the issuers to be irrefutably identified and that guarantees the immutability of the information.

The application of this technology in this context makes it possible to create a new sort of qualification that is more reliable, transparent, economical and faster. Its ability to guarantee the identity of the certification authority of the certificate represents a paradigm shift that is already beginning to revolutionize the sector.

## Advantages of the Trust Certification System.

### Security

Digital certificates cannot be altered or manipulated. They are generated and securely stored on a private blockchain network. Nothing and no one can change the information registered in the Blockchain.

### Integrity

They assure in the face of third parties the authenticity of the identity and the information they contained. The registered information can be verified by third parties, such as companies, selection committees, etc.

### Simplicity

Students or third parties can confirm the authenticity of the certificates immediately, using only the mobile phone.

### Ownership

The student or professional is the sovereign owner of the information and decides with whom to share it. The unequivocal identification of the individual or the products is guaranteed without the possibility of the information being falsified.

## Benefits for students, certification authorities and third parties

### Students

* Comfortable system to share and validate certificates

### Certificate Authorities

* Eliminate the possibility of forging certificates.
* Fast certification process.
* Cheaper process, we use our own monetary system based on ERC 20 tokens.
* It stick off as an innovative and avant-garde institution.
* Provides greater value for students.
* Preserves the prestige of the school by ensuring the veracity of the certificates.

### Third parties such as companies or other verification institutions.

* Ability to verify candidates' qualifications through a secure, fast and free system for the verifier.
* Safer selection processes that enable economic savings derived from hiring errors.
